I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech, where I am advised by [Dr. Ming Jin](http://www.jinming.tech). My research interests lie at the intersection of reinforcement learning, optimization, and statistical learning. More specifically, I am interested in how we can develop trustworthy reinforcement learning algorithms for real-world applications, which involve addressing challenges like non-stationarity, safety constraints, and off-policy data.

Before coming to Virginia Tech in 2019, I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Delhi Technological University, India. I received my Master's in Electrical Engineering in May 2021, where I was advised by  [Dr. Azim Eskandarian](https://asim.me.vt.edu/).
