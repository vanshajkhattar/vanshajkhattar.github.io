Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Ming Jin](http://www.jinming.tech). I am broadly interested in trustworthy reinforcement learning (RL) for real-world applications.

Prior to coming to Virginia Tech, in 2019 I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Delhi Technological University, India. I received my Master's in Electrical Engineering in May 2021, where I was fortunate to be advised by  [Dr. Azim Eskandarian](https://asim.me.vt.edu/).
